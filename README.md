# ESP32 & MiniD1 Communication

The working principle is quite simple. It works almost as with humans.
In order to connect two ESP8266, at least one of them must be an configured as Access Point and the other one as Client.
Once youâ€™ve connected them together you then need a way to make them talk each other. 
As humans do, while one is talking, the other one needs to listen.
The advantage of ESP8266 is that in the same time, can be both Client and Acces Point / Server.
